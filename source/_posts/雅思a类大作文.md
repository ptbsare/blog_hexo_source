雅思A类大作文，纯应试目的。
2015年1月31号，雅思A类大作文真题：

Some people argue that too much attention and too many resources are given to protect wild animals and birds. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Belatedly, some people or organizations are waking up to the grave harm caused by environmental damage, especially the species extinction. Yet there arises discords as to whether the prodigious amount of money, spent by these governments on animal protection, is too reckless and lavish or still scarce and deserving. Personally speaking, environmental protection including saving these animals in danger and reducing human pollution, is a long-term endeavor which involves vast hard work and a continuous input of money, because we human have really gone too far in ruining our ecological system.

The first step is to consider whether, though there seems to be an enormous quantity of money and other forms of assets thrown into the environmental-protection field, we have put into enough needful resources. The answer, I think, is no. According to some trustworthy statistics (thanks to some authentic research organizations), it is extremely hard, as somebody puts it, for the ecology of many environmentally devastated regions to rehabilitate to what it was before the mankind’s residence with the temporally spent resources. Namely, spending on restoring of the condition is paltry.

The second question considered is whether this costly laborious effort is worthy. It is easy to see that in most counties there exists a great discrepancy between money spent on making up for the productivity undermined by environmental destruction and its equivalent for environmental recovering. However, there are clearly confirmed evidences that the latter repays several times more than the former for the reason that some environmental problems, such as one that we call mass extinction involving various wild life progressively going vanished, still takes heavy human and economic toll. Thereby, contributing to protecting these animals produces decent return and hold out the hope of a huge distant pay-off to boost.

To end with, we can never investigate too much money into animal and birds protection. Similarly, it is never too late to get down to the animal-saving enterprise, which we should have done a long time ago.
